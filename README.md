The *sudokus* folder contains the unsolved sudokus.<br>
The *solutions* folder contains the solutions for the sudokus (for testing the solutions solver).<br>
The file [time.csv](./time.csv) is generated by the [sudoku_solver.pl](./sudoku_solver.pl) contains the solving time for each soduko.<br>
The file [time_optimized.csv](./time.csv) is generated by the [sudoku_solver_optimized.pl](./sudoku_solver.pl) contains the solving time for each soduko.<br>
